Access: https://globalwindatlas.info/api/gis/country/USA/wind-speed/10 
Input Data: 
• Raster: USA_wind-speed_10m.tif 
• Height: 10 m above ground 
• Units: meters per second (m/s) 
• Spatial resolution: ~250 m 
• Temporal representation: Long-term climatological mean 
Spatial Units: 
• WUI polygons (WUI_Polys.shp), n = 214 statewide WUI units 
Coordinate Reference System: 
12 
• Raster CRS: WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) 
• WUI polygons were reprojected to match the raster CRS prior to analysis. 
Processing Summary 
The national 10 m wind speed raster was cropped to the Hawaiian Islands using the bounding 
extent of the statewide WUI polygons to improve processing efficiency. The cropped raster 
was then masked to the WUI boundaries to retain wind values only within WUI areas. Mean 
wind speed was extracted for each WUI polygon using zonal statistics, excluding NoData 
values. Extracted values were joined back to the WUI attribute table and exported as both a 
shapefile and CSV. Wind speed was retained in meters per second and additionally converted 
to miles per hour for interpretability. 
Output Products 
• Statewide_WUI_Wind_Final.shp — WUI polygons with mean wind speed attributes 
• Statewide_WUI_Wind_Final.csv — Tabular WUI-level wind speed dataset 
Key Attributes: 
• Wind_ms — Mean 10 m wind speed (m/s) 
• Wind_mph — Mean 10 m wind speed (mph) 
Data Quality Notes 
Wind speed values represent long-term average conditions rather than event-scale winds. The 
dataset does not capture short-term gusts or extreme wind events but is appropriate for relative 
wildfire risk assessment and WUI-scale comparative analysis. 
Intended Use 
Fire environment characterization and inclusion as a meteorological predictor in the Hawaiʻi 
Wildfire Risk Assessment Index (WRAI), GLMM modeling, and multivariate analyses.
