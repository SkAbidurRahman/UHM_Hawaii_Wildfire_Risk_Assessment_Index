## Grass Cover (Herbaceous/Fine Fuel) — Metadata / Data Statement (WUI-scale)

**Dataset / Variable name(s)**

* `grass_mean` = mean fractional grass cover per WUI (0–1)
* `grass_median` = median fractional grass cover per WUI (0–1)
* `pct_dom_grass` = % of WUI area dominated by grass, defined as pixels with **grass > 0.50** (0–100)

---

### Source data

* **Grass raster:** `unmix_grass_2020_2023.tif`

  * Represents **fractional grass cover** per pixel (continuous values typically 0–1).
  * Time period: **2020–2023 composite** (as implied by filename).
* **WUI polygons:** `WUI_Polys.shp`

  * 214 statewide WUI units (your analysis units).

---

### Spatial characteristics

* **Geometry:** Raster (grass) + polygon zones (WUI)
* **Spatial resolution:** inherited from `unmix_grass_2020_2023.tif`
* **Extent:** Hawaiʻi statewide (final outputs clipped to WUI coverage)
* **CRS handling:** WUI polygons are **reprojected to match the raster CRS** before extraction (`project(wui, crs(grass))`).

### Processing summary (what your code does)

1. **Load** WUI polygons and the grass fractional cover raster.
2. **Reproject** WUI to the grass raster CRS to prevent misalignment.
3. **Crop** the grass raster to the WUI extent (efficiency step).
4. **Zonal statistics (continuous):**

   * Extract **mean** grass cover per WUI → `grass_mean`
   * Extract **median** grass cover per WUI → `grass_median`
5. **Dominance thresholding (binary):**

   * Create a binary raster where `grass > 0.50` (dominant grass pixel = 1, else 0).
   * Extract the **mean of the binary raster** per WUI → proportion of pixels dominated by grass.
   * Convert to percent → `pct_dom_grass = proportion * 100`
6. **Export outputs:**

   * Shapefile with appended fields: `WUI_Grass_Metrics_Final.shp`
   * Tabular summary: `WUI_Grass_Summary.csv`

### Outputs (deliverables)

* **Vector (for mapping / ArcGIS):**
  `C:/UHM/Thesis/Grass_Cover/WUI_Grass_Metrics_Final.shp`
* **Table (for modeling / QA/QC):**
  `C:/UHM/Thesis/Grass_Cover/WUI_Grass_Summary.csv`

### Data quality notes / interpretation

* `grass_mean` is sensitive to extreme values and mixed pixels; `grass_median` is more robust for skewed distributions.
* `pct_dom_grass` depends strongly on the chosen threshold (**0.50**). If you change the threshold (e.g., 0.40 or 0.60), document the justification (fuel continuity concept, field knowledge, or literature).
* Because WUI polygons and raster pixels rarely align perfectly, zonal summaries are **area/pixel-sampling approximations** of true cover within each polygon (still appropriate for WUI-scale comparative analysis).
