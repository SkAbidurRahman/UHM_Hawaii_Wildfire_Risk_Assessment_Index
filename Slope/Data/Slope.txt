Overview 
This dataset represents a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) developed by the U.S. 
Geological Survey and distributed via PacIOOS. The DEM provides a foundational terrain 
surface from which multiple physical landscape metrics can be derived. For wildfire and WUI 
exposure analysis, the DEM was used to compute slope and surface roughness, two key 
biophysical variables influencing fire spread, fireline intensity, suppression difficulty, and fuel 
5 
continuity patterns in Hawaiʻi. 
Attributes and Derivative Variables 
Slope 
• Computed using: terrain(dem, v="slope", unit="degrees") 
• Output unit: degrees 
• Interpretation: 
Higher slope increases fire rate-of-spread (ROS), flame tilt, and difficulty for ground 
suppression crews. 
Roughness 
• Computed using: terrain(dem, v="roughness") 
• Output unit: dimensionless (variance of elevation within a 3×3 kernel) 
• Interpretation: 
Higher roughness indicates heterogeneous terrain, cliffs, and ridges; lower values 
indicate smoother, flatter surfaces. 
Processing Workflow 
1. Downloaded 10-m DEM tiles from PacIOOS ERDDAP. 
2. Mosaicked DEM tiles into a single statewide DEM using terra. 
3. Removed Niʻihau DEM tile errors and cleaned coastline water artifacts. 
4. Projected DEM to UTM Zone 4N to align with fire-risk and WUI datasets. 
5. Computed slope raster from DEM (degrees). 
6. Computed roughness raster from DEM (local elevation variability). 
7. Applied land/water mask to remove ocean and non-land pixels. 
8. Clipped rasters to WUI polygons using terra::extract(). 
9. Calculated mean slope and mean roughness per WUI and exported as shapefile + 
CSV.

Data Quality Notes 
• DEM is high-quality but may contain localized errors (steep cliffs, cloud shadows in 
source LIDAR mosaics). 
• Coastlines and small islets may include minor artifacts. 
• Roughness depends on the 3×3 window; different kernel sizes produce different 
interpretation scales. 
• Resampling the DEM to match other raster datasets may slightly smooth the terrain.
