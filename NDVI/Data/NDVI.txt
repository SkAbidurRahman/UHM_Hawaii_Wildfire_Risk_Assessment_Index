Overview 
This dataset contains daily MODIS-based NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) 
rasters for the Hawaiian Islands, obtained from the Hawaiʻi Climate Data Portal (HCDP) for 
the period 2000–2025. NDVI is a dimensionless index derived from red and near-infrared 
reflectance that ranges approximately from −1 to +1, where higher values indicate denser and 
more photosynthetically active vegetation. The daily NDVI rasters were processed to produce 
monthly NDVI stacks, annual mean NDVI rasters, and a multi-year NDVI stack for use in 
wildfire exposure and WUI vulnerability analysis.

Key Attribute 
NDVI 
Variable name in rasters: NDVI band (single-band GeoTIFF) 
Units: unitless index (approximately −1 to +1) 
Interpretation: 
< 0: water, clouds, non-vegetated noise 
0–0.2: bare soil, sparse or senescent vegetation 
0.2–0.5: grassland, shrubs, mixed cover 
0.5: dense, healthy vegetation 
Processing Summary / Workflow 
1. Daily NDVI acquisition: 
Daily statewide NDVI rasters were downloaded from HCDP for each year (e.g., 
ndvi_modis_day_statewide_data_map_YYYY_MM_DD.tif). 
2. Monthly NDVI stacks: 
For each month, all valid daily NDVI rasters were loaded using terra (rast()), quality-checked, 
and stacked into a multi-layer raster (NDVI_Monthly_Stack_YYYY_MM.tif). Only existing 
and readable daily files were included. 
3. Annual mean NDVI: 
For each year, the 12 monthly stacks (or all available months) were loaded, merged into an 
annual stack, and the mean NDVI was computed across all monthly layers using app(..., mean, 
na.rm = TRUE). 
Output: NDVI_Annual_Mean_YYYY.tif. 
4. Multi-year annual NDVI stack (time series): 
All annual mean rasters from 2001–2025 were combined into a multi-band raster 
(NDVI_Annual_Stack_2001_2025.tif) to support time-series analysis and long-term 
vegetation trends. 
5. NDVI-based adjacency / continuity index: 
Annual NDVI was further thresholded to identify “vegetated” pixels (e.g., NDVI > 0.25 → 1, 
else 0), and a 3×3 focal window was used to calculate a local adjacency index (number of 
vegetated neighbors per cell). This produced a continuous NDVI adjacency index raster 
indicating local fuel continuity. 
6. WUI extraction: 
Wildland–Urban Interface (WUI) polygons were reprojected to match the NDVI raster CRS. 
Mean annual NDVI and the NDVI adjacency index were extracted per WUI polygon using 
terra::extract(..., fun = mean, na.rm = TRUE), and appended back to the WUI shapefile as new 
attributes.

Data Quality Notes 
• NDVI values are derived from MODIS satellite observations processed by HCDP and are 
subject to cloud cover, atmospheric effects, and sensor noise. 
• Daily data gaps (e.g., persistent cloud cover) and missing daily files may reduce the number 
of valid observations in some months; averaging is done with na.rm = TRUE to minimize bias. 
• Aggregation from daily → monthly → annual smooths short-term variability and emphasizes 
long-term vegetation condition. 
• Thresholds (e.g., NDVI > 0.25 for “vegetated”) are analytical choices and should be 
interpreted in the context of Hawaiʻi’s vegetation types and fuel models.
