Overview 
This dataset contains weekly U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) polygon classifications for 
Hawaiʻi from 2000–2024. Weekly drought categories (D0–D4) were rasterized to a 
common grid, converted to drought indicators, summarized as annual drought-week counts, 
averaged across years, and extracted to Wildland–Urban Interface (WUI) polygons. 
Attributes 
DM — Drought category code 
0 = No drought 
1 = D0 (Abnormally Dry) 
2 = D1 (Moderate Drought) 
3 = D2 (Severe Drought) 
4 = D3 (Extreme Drought) 
5 = D4 (Exceptional Drought) 
Processing Summary / Workflow 
Download weekly USDM shapefiles (≈4–5 per month). 
Organize files by year. 
Rasterize weekly polygons to a ~500 m grid using max(DM) per cell.

This dataset quantifies grass abundance and spatial dominance across Hawaiʻi’s Wildland
Urban Interface (WUI). Using a spectral unmixed grass product, the analysis calculates the 
average fractional cover and the total land area where grass constitutes the dominant fuel 
type (defined as ≥50% cover per pixel). This serves as a proxy for fine fuel continuity in 
fire risk modeling. 
Attributes 
• grass_mean - Average fractional grass cover per WUI unit (0–1 scale). 
• grass_median - Median fractional grass cover per WUI unit (0–1 scale). 
• pct_dom_grass - Percentage of WUI area where grass is dominant (pixels > 0.50). 
Processing Summary / Workflow 
1. Data Loading: Import statewide WUI polygons (214 units) and 30m fractional grass 
raster. 
2. Alignment & Cropping: Project WUI polygons to match raster CRS and crop the raster 
to the WUI extent. 
3. Intensity Extraction: Calculate mean and median pixel values (0–1) per WUI polygon 
to quantify grass density. 
4. Thresholding: Reclassify pixels into a binary raster ($1 = >50\%$ cover; $0 = \le 
50\%$ cover) to identify areas of fuel dominance. 
5. Spatial Aggregation: Calculate the mean of the binary raster per polygon to determine 
the proportion of grass-dominated area. 
6. Final Scaling: Convert proportions to percentages (0–100%) and export as .shp and .csv.

Data Quality Notes 
⚫ Spectral Unmixing: Values represent sub-pixel fractions; a value of 0.50 means 50% 
of the 30m pixel is identified as herbaceous fuel. 
⚫ Fuel Continuity: The 50% threshold is a standard heuristic used to identify where 
fine fuels are likely continuous enough to support fire spread. 
⚫ Data Vintage: The raster represents a composite/average of conditions between 2020 
and 2023.
