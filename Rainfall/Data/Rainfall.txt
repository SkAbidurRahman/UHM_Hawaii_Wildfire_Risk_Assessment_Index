Overview 
This dataset represents long-term mean annual rainfall for Hawaiʻi derived from high
resolution monthly rainfall rasters produced by the Hawaiʻi Climate Data Portal. Monthly 
rainfall totals were summed to annual totals for each year (2000–2024), then averaged across 
all years to generate a statewide mean annual rainfall surface. The resulting raster was spatially 
summarized for each WUI polygon to support wildfire risk and vulnerability analysis. 
Processing Summary / Workflow 
1. Load monthly rainfall GeoTIFFs for each year (12 months/year). 
2. Sum monthly rasters → annual total rainfall per year. 
3. Stack annual rasters (2000–2024). 
4. Compute pixel-wise mean → long-term mean annual rainfall. 
5. Extract mean rainfall values to WUI polygons. 
6. Join extracted values to WUI attributes and export.

Data Quality Notes 
• Rainfall surfaces are interpolated estimates based on station data and kriging methods. 
• Spatial uncertainty varies across islands; coastal and high-elevation areas may have 
higher error. 
• Long-term averaging smooths interannual variability and extremes.
