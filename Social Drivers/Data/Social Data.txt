# Social Drivers Metadata (ACS → WUI Area-Weighted)

**Source:**
U.S. Census Bureau, **American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year Estimates, 2023 release (2019–2023)**

**Access:**
Downloaded programmatically using the **tidycensus** R package and official Census API.

**Input Data:**
• Polygon layer: Census **tract geometries** (ACS 5-year, Hawaiʻi)
• Social variables derived from ACS tables:
 – Population: total population
 – Income: median household income
 – Poverty: percent below poverty line
 – Employment: percent unemployed
 – Education: percent < high school; percent bachelor’s+
 – Disability: percent with disability
 – Housing: percent renter-occupied
 – Transportation: percent households without vehicle
 – Connectivity: percent households without internet
 – Age structure: percent under age 5; percent age 65+

**Spatial Units:**
• **Input:** Census tracts (ACS geography)
• **Output:** **WUI polygons** (*WUI_Polys.shp*), **n = 214 statewide WUI units**

**Coordinate Reference System:**
• ACS tracts (raw): NAD83 geographic
• Analysis CRS: **NAD83 / UTM Zone 4N (EPSG:26904)**
• All layers reprojected to EPSG:26904 prior to intersection and weighting.

# Processing Summary

ACS tract-level social variables were first downloaded and cleaned using reproducible R scripts.
To align social data with wildfire-relevant spatial units, **area-weighted spatial interpolation** was applied:

1. Census tracts and WUI polygons were projected to **UTM Zone 4N**.
2. **Geometric intersection** was performed to create tract–WUI fragments.
3. **Area weights** were computed as:
     intersection area ÷ total WUI polygon area.
4. **Area-weighted means** of all social variables were calculated for each WUI.
5. Weighted values were **joined back to WUI polygons**.
6. Final datasets were exported as **shapefile and CSV** for modeling and mapping.

This approach ensures **spatial comparability** between demographic data and wildfire-analysis units.

# Data Quality Notes

• ACS values are **survey-based estimates** with sampling uncertainty.
• Census tracts and WUI boundaries **do not spatially align**, requiring interpolation.
• Area-weighted interpolation **assumes uniform distribution of population within tracts**, which may introduce bias in heterogeneous landscapes.
• Weighted WUI population totals may differ from statewide ACS totals due to:
 – Partial tract overlap with WUI boundaries
 – Coastal/ocean clipping
 – Spatial interpolation effects

Despite these limitations, the dataset is appropriate for **relative social vulnerability comparison across WUI units**.

# Intended Use

Integration of **social vulnerability drivers** into:

• Hawaiʻi Wildfire Risk Assessment Index (WRAI)
• GLMM wildfire ignition and exposure modeling
• Multivariate risk analysis and prioritization of fire-prone communities
• Decision support for **HWMO and land-management partners**
